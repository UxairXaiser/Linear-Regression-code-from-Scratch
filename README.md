# Linear-Regression-code-from-Scratch
Implements linear regression from scratch with gradient descent on noisy synthetic data over 1000 epochs. It visualizes the model's progress, tests single input predictions, and compares the results with scikit-learnâ€™s LinearRegression, providing insights into model performance and convergence.
